# Portable Mode

%product% fully supports "portable mode". However, you have to manually enable it as it is uncommon.

## Before you start

Make sure that:
- You have downloaded `.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aloneguid/bt/releases).
- You have extracted `bt.exe` into a dedicate folder on removable media.

## Making it portable

%product% will check if `.portable` file exists in the same folder as `bt.exe` is located. And if it does,

<procedure title="Portable mode">
<step>
<code>config.ini</code> will be placed alongside `bt.exe`.
</step>
<step>
Rule Hit Log will be placed alongside `bt.exe` if turned on.
</step>
</procedure>

## Creating portable marker

You can create `.portable` file either manually in any editor, or using the following PowerShell snippet:

```bash
New-Item .portable -Type File
```
