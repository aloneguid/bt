# Prerequisites

Once launched, %product% will perform a quick self-check and warn you which actions need to be performed by you for links to be properly proxied by it.

Health status is also available in the bottom status bar (green and red heart).

## Register as proxy browser

This is required in order for Windows to think that %product% is just another browser. It affects the OS dialogs allowing you to pick Browser Tamer from the list of various browsing options.

## Set as HTTP(S) protocol handler

Required in order for Windows to offer protocol handling (http and https links) by %product%. This also checks that Browser Tamer was indeed set as the default handler.

<warning>
For security reasons, %product% does not automatically fix this issue, but rather opens a Windows dialog with default handlers, where you need to do it yourself.
</warning>
