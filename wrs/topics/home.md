# Welcome to %product%!

## Pitch
Do you have multiple browsers or browser profiles on your machine? Do you want to open different links with different browsers or profiles without switching manually?

If yes, then you need %product%! It's a smart and powerful tool that acts as a browser proxy on your machine. It catches the links you click and redirects them to a browser or browser profile of your choice. You can set up rules based on the linkâ€™s domain, protocol, file extension and more.
