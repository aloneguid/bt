## 4.3.0

This version enhances command line support, specifically allowing you to use terminal to list browsers and profiles comfigured in Browser Tamer, get default browser and set default browser. This is useful for scripting and automation. Read more [in the documentation](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/commandline.html#terminal-commands).

Overview on YouTube:

## 4.2.5

### Bugs fixed

- If pipeline processing function written in Lua was not returning any value, BT would stop processing the rules.
- Lua scripts for rule checks were not invoked at all for external links.
- Watch a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/15Uf8DsL6VU) on Lua scripting.


## 4.2.4

### Improvements

- Chromium-based browsers will receive "--no-default-browser-check" parameter when launched. This will prevent the browser from asking to be the default browser, because we all know Browser Tamer is the default browser. We don't need to be reminded of this every time we open a link. Running re-discovery is required for this to be added in. I was listening to you, @oscarorange in #103.
- Prevent config and picker window from flickering in annoying white when first shown. Say goodbye to unintentional light shows! Your eyes will no longer be subjected to the AI's attempt at being a strobe light. Consider this our peace offering.

### Cosmetic changes

- Eliminate ImGui warnings in Pipeline debugger. No more ugly warning messages. Our debugger is now as pristine as a freshly cleaned whiteboard.
- Set application test page to a dedicated web page. Finally, the test page gets its own room.

Due to the increasing popularity of Browser Tamer, we now have an official rock ballad you can listen to:

## 4.2.3

This release does not change or improve any core functionality and only touches the configuration utility in the following ways:
- Configuration utility now uses built-in system font "Segoe UI".
- Lua script editor uses monospaced font "Consolas".
- Fonts are rendered with "FreeType" rendered which is more accurate and looks better.

## 4.2.2

### Improvements

- Main configuration window can be maximised.

### Bugs fixed

- "Launch in chromeless window" was not working for some time.
- "Message from dear IMGUI" error fixed in process picker and dashboard warning.

## 4.2.1

### New

### Improvements

- Rule editor now has a helper function to list currently running processes when working with "Process" rule.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0dc1a97-da66-470c-9a64-d6a8173ec7c0)

- For people who have a lot of profiles (like @AJolly in #109), tab list is now scrollable, and we have a tab list as well:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1028259e-6b6f-44e3-8772-9a616c60d160)

- If a browser could not be launched, a system error message is shown with details (#98).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c556f23d-8a3c-43d0-923b-af2715b9ca27)


## 4.2.0

### New features:

- Ability to hide profiles, in addition to the browsers (#71). Thanks to @ilapro53 for the idea.
- Picker option "always on top" will make sure picker always shows on top of other windows (off by default).
- Added configuration option to manually invoke Picker when `CAPS LOCKS` is on.
- Picker includes an extra menu to the right of browser list, which at the moment has two extra options:
  - Copy link to clipboard and close picker.
  - Email link with a default email client.


## 4.1.2

"Close on focus loss" option was not working properly. Thanks to @rp1231.

## 4.1.1

### Improvements
- ⌨️ Keyboard is back, but it's even better now. Picker can be [controlled with keyboaard keys](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/picker.html#keyboard-navigation). Thanks to @aaronransley.
- Picker window can be optionally dismissed on focus loss, the option is off by default and can be enabled from the `Picker` menu. Thanks to @rp1231 in #86.


## 4.1.0

### New features
- Introducing [**Pipeline debugger**](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/debugger.html) - a very detailed representation of how BT processes URLs that can be used to understand BT and test how rules and substitutions are applied. Accessible from the `Tools` menu.
- BT can write log file to "log.txt" in the same directory as `config.ini`. This is useful for debugging and understanding how BT processes URLs. Log file is off by default and can be enabled from the `General` menu.
- [Lua scripting](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/scripting.html) for more advanced url processing and rule matching. This is still a very new feature, therefore some bugs can be expected.

### Improvements
- More URL un-shorteners supported.
- You can turn pipeline substitutions on and off without deleting substitutions. This is accessible from the "Pipeline" menu.
- Some pleaces in the UI are getting "online help" hyperlink to a relevant documentation section.

### Bugs fixed
- bt.exe was hanging in the background with no picker UI shown. First seen when invoking from Slack, but could happen in other apps too. Thanks to @maddada in #93.

## 4.0.3

New features:
- Browser Tamer now has AI. When you click on a link, it does predict which browser you want to open it in. This is based on what you have configued to open in the configuration window.
- Browser tamer can now predict time using sophisticated AI algorithms. We know what time it will be in 5 minutes, and we can predict it with 100% accuracy. You don't need GPU or AI chip for this to work and BT still utilizes 0% of your CPU.

Improvements:
- UX: Picker menu makes it clear which mouse button to click (thanks to @rp1231 in discussion #85).
- UX: Picker would not show in the taskbar (reported by @maddada in #88).
- UX: Picker window will not resize itself, but rather ergonimically reposition browsers and profiles depending on selection. This is because jumping window size was annoying and caused some health issues for some users with epilepsy.
- Brower Tamer will now use native Windows OS window chrome instead of custom ones. This is to make it more consistent with the rest of the system and to avoid some issues with other tools that rely on native window chrome. The chrome will also adopt to the Browser Tamer theme you have selected i.e. it will be dark or light depending on your theme prevalence.

## 4.0.2

Fixed a bug where picker would not show up if it was configured to be shown on conflict or always. Thanks to @Mythrix in #40.

## 4.0.1

- Browsers installed via Windows Store (Firefox) are automatically detected and added to the list.
- [Arc browser](https://arc.net/) is fully supported.
- visual appeal: firefox/chromium autodetected browsers are now displayed with a different icon.

## 4.0.0

- Multiple picker hotkeys can be configured, you can even turn them all on at the same time.
- "URL tester" is now built into main configuration window and highlights matched browsers, profiles and rules. This is to avoid confusion and make it more ergonomic.
- Redesigned menu structure, moving items where they belong.
- URL Picker is completely rewritten. Browsers and profiles are now listed as a tree view, removing the need to sort flat list by some means like popularity or user-defined order.
- You can assign your own custom icon to custom defined browsers.
- You can assign your own custom icon to browser profiles or firefox containers.
- Added three new UI themes - "Darcula", "Steam" and "DUCK RED".
- UI Theme selector has two-color half-square preview icon.
- Updates to latest version of ImGui and MSVC compiler.

## 3.7.3

### New feature

- Added support for opening links in "no container" in Firefox container mode. Thanks to @benaduggan in #69.
- [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) is now recognized as a Firefox-compatible browser.

## 3.7.2

### Bugs fixed
- Latest version of Firefox omits ':' character from the URL when it's passed to the browser. This was causing BT to not be able to open URLs from Firefox. Thanks to @jnv in #68.
- Chrome incognito mode was not working due to a bug in the way BT was passing arguments to the browser. Thanks to @magesh-memorres in #66.

## 3.7.1

### Improvements

- Hopefully fixed browser being backgrounded for some users (#39).

## 3.7.0

### New features

- Introducing **URL Pipeline**. BT now allows you to to define custom find and replace rules on URLs before applying rules to them. Simple strings and regular expressions are supported. Read more about this in the [official docs](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/url-pipeline.html).

### Improvements

- Upgraded dependencies to latest.
- Un-shortener supports `vrch.at` shortlinks, by @Bluscream in #62.

### Bugs fixed

- BT crashed with unhandled exception when regular expression rule was executing a regex with invalid syntax (#59). Thanks @egerlach.
- Pipe `|` and colon `:` in rule values were screwing up configuration (#59, 67). Thanks to @liny01-nbsa and @egerlach.
- Empty rule would make URL Tester hang.

> As you may have noticed, the number of releases went down in frequency. This is mostly due to the fact I wanted to sort out AV false-positives by contacting AV vendors one by one, and this is a long and tedious process which has nothing to do with technology.
>
> Remember, if you like this project and wish and can to support it, you can always star :star: it, which helps a lot in terms of spreading the word. Optionally, if you can, you can :coffee: [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/alonecoffee) as well.

## 3.6.2

🐞Fixed: BT hangs waiting for browser proxy process to terminate. Thanks to @cjs1976 and @fixator10 in #51.

## 3.6.1

🐞Fixed: when external monitor is set as primary, picker is shown on a wrong monitor. Thanks to @ianzhuo in #48.

## 3.6.0

### New

- You can create rules based on [application title and process name](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/rules.html#matching-locations).
- URL picker displays extra metadata if known: [process name and window title](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/picker.html).
- Added support for [Thorium Browser](https://thorium.rocks/) (#43 for @paz)

### Improvements

- Picker is shown on the monitor 💻 of the source application instead of always defaulting to main monitor, thanks to @mahoromax in #42.
- Picker allows selecting first 10 browsers with a 🔢 number key, thanks to @coromd for the idea in #38!
- Theming improvements:
  - Better dark theme.
  - Theme switching was leaving some colours from the old theme.
  - Button colours on lite theme do not look ugly anymore.
- Update checks removed to avoid bugging users. You can still check from them from "Help" menu.


### Bugs Fixed

- do not show hidden browser's profiles in picker (#41 for @mahoromax).
- crash on update check when no internet available (#44 for @neoOpus).

## 3.5.2

Resolves an issue when Chromium browsers are not brought to foreground. Thanks to @tallen1983 in #39.

> Not using `ShellExecute` and waiting for successful process handle seems to be making Chromium happy.

## 3.5.1

**New feature!** [Office 365 link unwrapping](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/url-processing.html#office-365-link-unwrapping) implemented, thanks to @maluht in #36.

## 3.5.0

### New

- Added support for [URL un-shortening](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/url-processing.html#un-shortening).
- Tray menu has "URL Tester" shortcut.
- "buy me a coffee" link removed from the tray icon and status bar, because no one is donating. Everything irrelevant removed too, trying to be more ergonomic.

### Improvements

- Slightly redesigned "URL Tester" window for better user workflow.

### Bugs Fixed

- Clicking on update notification was opening home page, but it should just go to [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/aloneguid/bt/releases).

## 3.4.2

Bug fixed - picker was always defaulting to "chrome-less window". Thanks to @danarnold in #20.

## 3.4.1

Bug fixed - when editing rule, you could not jump to next edit box with `tab` or previous with `shift`+`tab`.

## 3.4.0

### New

- When editing browser profiles, you can optionally add your own custom arguments to pass to the browser (see `extra args`). Thanks to @AJolly for the idea.
- URL Picker has an option to turn off recording of "popularity".
- [Documentation website](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/home.html) is now live. It's small and simple, but allows to add more structured content, unlike blog pages.
- Ability to hide browsers from configuration window was added. This affects both configuration and picker, so you won't see browsers you are not interested in.
- Rules can be reordered by simply pressing ⬆️ or ⬇️ keys on the keyboard. Thanks to @maluht for the idea in #13.
- When editing rule, you can jump to next edit box with `tab` or previous with `shift`+`tab`.

- GitHub releases publishes SHA-256 checksums.

### Improvements

- Updating custom browser name will also update it in browser list as you type.

### Bugs Fixed

- Picker would not work if you enable "frameless window" but pick a browser that does not support this feature. Browser list now also indicates if browser supports frameless feature. Thanks to @D3XX3R in #20.
- Tray icon tooltip was not displaying. It should have shown application name and version number.

## 3.3.1

- Rule hits can can be optionally recorded to a CSV file (off by default). To enable, check `Settings`->`Log Rule Hits to File`. This creates `hit_log.csv` which you can open from the `File` menu. Feature is useful for recording your activity for further analysis to exporting to some analytical engine.

### Bugs Fixed

- Config window was not deleted from memory after closing it.
- Update check was happening on every start instead of every 24 hours.

## 3.3.0

### New

- Match rules support regular expressions syntax.
- Support for Firefox Containers added! Firefox containers link redirection works with [Open external links in a container by Denys H](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/open-url-in-container/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) extension or my own [Browser Tamer extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/browser-tamer/).
- Added [Firefox integration extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/browser-tamer/) (link available from `Help` menu) and published source code for Chromium and Firefox extensions.
- Added native support for [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/). This means BT will treat Waterfox just like Firefox, including support for profiles, private mode, containers and the rest.

### Improvements

- `config.ini` is slightly simpler - removed `open_cmd` and `vdf` keys as they are not required anymore.
- Browser profiles are sorted by the order they appear in the browser itself instead of alphabetically.
- Chromium browsers have a convenience toolbar button that links to browser store to download optional integration extension.
- Visual: "incognito" modes are marked with a visual icon.
- Firefox: profile discovery skips `default` profile which is intended for some kind of alpha testing and has no meaning to a normal user. `default-release` profiles is now displayed as `Primary` as this is exactly what it is.
- Infrastructure: release notes are removed from application code and replaced by a [link to GitHub](https://github.com/aloneguid/bt/releases) to avoid duplication and gradually increasing application size as they grow.

### Bugs Fixed

- health check: if BT is installed as browser but to a different directory than you are launching from, validation was still succeeding.
- health check: status icon was not updating after health is fixed from dashboard.

### Improvements

- Various code stability improvements
- Added 'Add' button to the main UI, to emplasise you can add your custom browser. Previously it was available only from the File menu.


### Bugs Fixed

- BT would crash on start of configuration window for new installations due to expecting at least one browser to be registered.


## 3.1.6

### New Features

- Rules can have priorities in case multiple browsers match with similar rules.


### Improvements

- Added automation test suite based on Google Test. For you it means the app gets more rock-solid.

## 3.1.0

### New Features

- Custom browser's profiles are now just custom browsers, making custom-registered browser experience more ergonomic. They can be added from File menu.
- Metrics window is completely removed. I've decided this app should do one thing but do it well and metrics is just outside of the scope of Browser Tamer core functionality. There are plenty of tools to investigate performance, including ones built into Windows itself.
- File menu has new option - 'copy path to config.ini' which copies it to clipboard.


### Improvements

- Browser list in config window is sorted - system browsers alphabetically, then custom browsers alphabetically. Profiles are sorted alphabetically to, incognito being at the end. All of the sorting is case-insensitive.
- Freed up configuration real estate by moving 'test' button to the rest of browser control buttons.
- Window scaling errors fixed for certain monitors.
- Config window status bar text doesn't jump around when width change.
- All of the browsers have a running icon indicator, including user-defined.


### Bugs Fixed

- Browser profile overlays in the picker are rounded similar to how Chromium paints them.
- Multi-window interface


### Bugs Fixed

## 2.9.7

### Improvements

- PDF association has a different icon


## 2.9.6

### New Features

It’s super small and super fast.


## 1.0

### New Features

- Sort of a first release.
